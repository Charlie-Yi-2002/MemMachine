# Project Maintenance

Maintaining a project involves more than just writing and reviewing code; it encompasses a set of crucial tasks that ensure the project's long-term health, security, and usability.

## Keeping Dependencies Up to Date

Dependencies are external libraries or packages that your project relies on for its functionality. Keeping them up to date is essential for security and stability.

- **Responding to Dependabot Alerts:** Dependabot will automatically create pull requests for security vulnerabilities. These are typically critical and should be merged as soon as possible after a quick review to ensure tests pass.

- **Managing Version Updates:** Dependabot can also be configured to open pull requests for regular version updates. Review these to check for breaking changes in the library's release notes before merging.

## Ensuring Tests Are Passing

The project's test suite is its first line of defense against bugs. It's a maintainer's responsibility to ensure the tests are always passing on the `main` branch.

- **Monitor Continuous Integration (CI):** When reviewing pull requests, verify the status of the automated checks. If a test fails, do not merge the PR. Work with the contributor to resolve the issue.

- **Resolve Build Failures:** If a commit that was merged to `main` causes a test failure, you should immediately work on a fix. This is a top-priority task to ensure the branch remains stable.

## Updating Documentation

Outdated documentation is a major source of confusion for both new and existing users. As a maintainer, you should ensure the project's documentation is always accurate and easy to understand.

- **Update the `README.md`:** The `README.md` is the first thing people see when they visit your repository. Ensure it accurately reflects the project's current status and includes clear instructions on how to get started.

- **Maintain Other Docs:** As the codebase evolves, other documentation files—such as the files in your `docs/` directory—may need to be updated. When you merge a pull request that changes a feature or adds a new one, make sure the corresponding documentation is updated as part of the PR.
