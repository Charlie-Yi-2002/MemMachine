The assistant will analyze your existing email writing style and generate content that matches your tone, formality level, sentence structure, and other characteristics.

## ProfileMemory Integration

The writing assistant integrates with MemMachine's ProfileMemory system to:

1. **Store Style Characteristics**: Each writing sample is analyzed and stored as profile entries with the tag format `writing_style_{content_type}`
2. **Retrieve Style Data**: When generating content, the assistant retrieves relevant style characteristics for the requested content type
3. **Update Profiles**: New writing samples update and refine existing style profiles
4. **Maintain Separation**: Different content types maintain separate style profiles to preserve context-appropriate writing patterns

This ensures that your writing style is preserved and consistently applied across all generated content while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to different content types and contexts.
