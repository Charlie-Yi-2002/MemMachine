## Bug Report

The `helloworld.py` example from the [official docs](https://docs.memmachine.ai/getting_started/quickstart#pythonsdk) does not work when running MemMachine inside a Docker environment. The current example assumes the server and code are installed via `pip install` or from source, which is not the case in most Docker-based deployments.

### Root Cause
- The Hello World example is primarily designed for back-end developers who have access to the source code or a pip-installed environment.
- This approach is incompatible with Docker container setups, where such access is not always available.

### Proposed Solution
- Develop a new `HelloWorld.py` example that uses the new Python Client SDK if available.
- Alternatively, demonstrate how to use the REST APIs for Hello World functionality until the client SDKs are production-ready.

### Impact
- Improves onboarding for developers using Docker.
- Aligns documentation and examples with modern deployment practices.
