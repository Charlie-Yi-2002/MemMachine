Welcome to the MemMachine evaluation toolsets! We've created two simple tools to help you measure the performance and response quality of your MemMachine instance. You can use both of these to get a LoCoMo score for your system.

- **Episodic Memory Tool Set:** This tool measures how fast and accurately MemMachine performs core episodic memory tasks. For a list of specific commands, check out the [Episodic Memory Tool Set](./locomo/episodic_memory/README.md).
- **Episodic Profile Agent Tool Set:** This tool is designed to evaluate the speed and quality of MemMachine's Profile Agent. For a list of specific commands, check out the [Episodic Profile Agent Tool Set](./locomo/episodic_profile_agent/README.md).

## Getting Started

Before you run any benchmarks, you'll need to set up your environment.

**General Prerequisites:**

- **MemMachine Backend:** Both tools require that your MemMachine backend be installed and configured. If you need help with this, you can check out our [QuickStart Guide](http://docs.memmachine.ai/getting_started/quickstart).

- **Start the Backend:** Once everything is set up, start MemMachine with this command:

  ```sh
  memmachine-server
  ```

**Tool-Specific Prerequisites:**

- **Episodic Memory:** For this tool, please ensure your `cfg.yml` file has been copied into your `locomo` directory (`/memmachine/evaluation/locomo/`) and renamed to `locomo_config.yaml`.
- **Episodic Profile Agent:** This tool requires your MCP Server to be running before you run any commands.

## Running the Benchmark

Ready to go? Follow these simple steps. 

**A.** All commands should be run from their respective tool directory (e.g., `locomo/episodic_memory/` or `locomo/episodic_profile_agent/`).

**B.** The path to your data file, `locomo10.json`, should be updated to match its location. By default, you can find it in `/memmachine/evaluation/locomo/`.

**C.** Once you have performed step 1 below, you can repeat the benchmark run by performing steps 2-4.  Once are you finished performing the benchmark, run step 5.

**Note:** Although the process is simple, the commands for each type of Tool Set may differ.  Please refer to the [Episodic Memory Tool Set](./locomo/episodic_memory/README.md) or [Episodic Profile Agent Tool Set](./locomo/episodic_profile_agent/README.md) for the exact commands for each step, respective to the Benchmark you wish to run.

<Steps>
<Step title="Ingest a Conversation">

First, let's add conversation data to MemMachine. This only needs to be done once per test run.

</Step>
<Step title="Search the Conversation">

Let's search through the data you just added.

</Step>
<Step title="Evaluate the Responses">

Next, run a LoCoMo evaluation against the search results.

</Step>
<Step title="Generate Your Final Score">

Once the evaluation is complete, you can generate the final scores.

The output will be a table in your shell showing the mean scores for each category and an overall score, like the example below:

```sh
Mean Scores Per Category:
          llm_score  count         type
category                               
1            0.8050    282    multi_hop
2            0.7259    321     temporal
3            0.6458     96  open_domain
4            0.9334    841   single_hop

Overall Mean Scores:
llm_score    0.8487
dtype: float64
```

</Step>
<Step title="Clean Up Your Data">

When you're finished, you may want to delete the test data. This is especially important before running a different benchmark.
