# REST API Examples


 ## Hello World: A Guide to the MemMachine RESTful API

This guide provides a quick and simple way to get started with the MemMachine RESTful API using `curl` commands.  It can also be found in our [Quick Start Guide](https://memmachine.ai/docs/getting-started/quick-start-guide).

### Prerequisites

First, make sure your FastAPI application is running. Open your terminal, navigate to the directory containing your `app.py` file, and run the following command. The output should confirm that the server is listening for requests.

```
uvicorn app:app --reload
```
<Steps>
<Step title="Get All Sessions">

The simplest way to start is by checking for existing sessions. This `GET` request doesn't require any data. You will likely see an empty list since no sessions have been created yet.

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/sessions
```
</Step>
<Step title="Add a New Memory">

This is where you'll create your first memory episode. The `POST /v1/memories` endpoint requires a JSON body that includes session details, a producer, a recipient, and the content of the memory itself.

**Command:**

```
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/memories" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "session": {
    "group_id": "test_group",
    "agent_id": ["test_agent"],
    "user_id": ["test_user"],
    "session_id": "session_123"
  },
  "producer": "test_user",
  "produced_for": "test_agent",
  "episode_content": "This is a simple test memory.",
  "episode_type": "message",
  "metadata": {}
}'
```

**Expected Output:**

You will receive an empty `200 OK` response, confirming the memory was added successfully.
</Step>
<Step title="Search for the Memory">

Now that a memory has been added, let's try to find it. The `POST /v1/memories/search` endpoint also requires a JSON body to specify the search query and session.

**Command:**

```
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/memories/search" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "session": {
    "group_id": "test_group",
    "agent_id": ["test_agent"],
    "user_id": ["test_user"],
    "session_id": "session_123"
  },
  "query": "simple test memory",
  "filter": {},
  "limit": 5
}'
```

**Expected Output:**

You should see a `200 OK` response containing the search results, including the memory episode you just added. The output will be formatted as a JSON object, confirming that your memory was successfully found.
</Step>
<Step title=" Delete the Session Data">

To clean up after your test, you can use the `DELETE /v1/memories` endpoint. This also requires a JSON body to specify which session's data should be removed.

**Command:**

```
curl -X DELETE "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/memories" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "session": {
    "group_id": "test_group",
    "agent_id": ["test_agent"],
    "user_id": ["test_user"],
    "session_id": "session_123"
  }
}'
```
</Step>
