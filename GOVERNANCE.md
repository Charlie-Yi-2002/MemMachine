# MemMachine Project Governance

This document outlines the governance model for the MemMachine project, a
community-driven open-source initiative. Our goal is to create a transparent,
meritocratic, and collaborative environment where every contributor can grow
their influence and shape the future of the project.

## 1. Project Philosophy

The MemMachine project operates on a meritocratic model. All participants are
recognized for their contributions, and influence in the project is earned
through active, sustained, and meaningful engagement with the community.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

The project recognizes several distinct roles, each with increasing levels of
responsibility and trust.

### User

- **Definition:** A member of the community who uses the project's software.
- **Responsibilities:** Providing feedback, reporting bugs, and participating
  in discussions.

#### Contributor

- **Definition:** A user who makes a direct contribution to the project, such as
  submitting a bug report, creating a pull request for a new feature, or
  improving documentation.
- **Responsibilities:** Adhering to the project's Code of Conduct, style guides,
  and contributing guidelines.

#### Maintainer

- **Definition:** A long-term contributor who has demonstrated a high level of
  commitment, expertise, and positive community engagement. Maintainers are
  granted **write access** to the repository.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Reviewing and merging pull requests.
  - Triage and manage issues.
  - Mentoring new contributors.
  - Participating in project discussions and decision-making.

#### Technical Council

- **Definition:** A small group of individuals elected from the Maintainer team.
  The Technical Council provides strategic and technical oversight for the
  project as a whole.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Setting the project's strategic roadmap.
  - Guiding the maintainer team.
  - Enforcing the Code of Conduct.
  - Serving as the public face of the project.

### 3. Decision-Making Process

Decisions within the MemMachine project are made by **Lazy Consensus**, a
process where a decision is considered approved if no one objects within a
specific timeframe. For any proposal or change, a vote will be held for a
period of 72 hours.

- A proposal is considered accepted if no objections are raised.
- If a strong objection is raised, a public discussion will be held to find a
  path forward.
- If consensus cannot be reached, the Project Leads will make the final
  decision.

### 4. How to Become a Maintainer

Becoming a maintainer is based on demonstrated merit and trust within the
community. The path to becoming a maintainer is as follows:

1. **Sustained Contribution:** Consistently contribute high-quality code,
   documentation, or other valuable work over a period of several months.

2. **Community Engagement:** Actively participate in issues, discussions, and
   code reviews, demonstrating a positive and helpful attitude.

3. **Nomination:** An existing maintainer or Project Lead will nominate you for
   the role.

4. **Voting:** The existing maintainer team will vote on the nomination.
   A majority vote is required.

### 5. Conflict Resolution and Code of Conduct

All members of the MemMachine community are expected to follow the
[Code of Conduct](https://www.google.com/search?q=CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). All
issues or conflicts should be resolved in a professional and respectful manner,
as outlined in the Code of Conduct's Reporting Guidelines.
